# Explanation of Data Ingestion

This integration supports three types of data ingestion: **IOC Stream**, **DTM Alerts**, and **ASM Issues**. If an ingestion type is not selected while configuring asset, data ingestion will not occur. Only one data ingestion type can be configured per asset. To configure multiple data ingestions, set up multiple assets.

The below details describes the configuration and usage of the GTI integration for Splunk SOAR, focusing on the three on-poll ingestion types: **IOC Stream**, **DTM Alerts**, and **ASM Issues**.

## Details about On-Poll Ingestion

### Poll Now Feature

The **Poll Now** action retrieves the most recent 1 hour of data for all three ingestion types: **IOC Stream**, **DTM Alerts**, and **ASM Issues**.

**Important Notes:**
- The *Poll Now* feature **ignores** the following parameters: **Source ID**, **Maximum containers**, and **Maximum artifacts**.
- It does **not** store a checkpoint file, meaning it will always pull the most recent 1 hour of data regardless of previous ingestions.
- When using *Poll Now* for **IOC Stream**, duplicate artifacts may be ingested into the current day's container if those artifacts already exist, since SOAR does **not** automatically remove duplicates.


**Recommended Ingestion Interval:**  
  Set the ingestion interval to 1 hour for optimal performance and timely data updates. Please note that using very short intervals may negatively impact data ingestion efficiency and the overall performance of your instance. 

**Limit Parameter:**  
  The `limit` parameter controls the maximum number of records ingested per poll. The maximum allowed value is **1000**; if a higher or invalid value is set, it will be ignored and **1000** will be used.

**Lookback Days Parameter:**  
  The `lookback_days` parameter determines how many days back the integration will look for data during the initial poll. The maximum allowed value is **5**; if a higher or invalid value is set, it will be ignored and **5** will be used. Days are calculated as the absolute day difference from the current time.

## IOC Stream

- **Parameters:**
  - **Descriptors Only:** Includes only object descriptors, not full VT objects (boolean, default: false).
  - **Filter:** Filter string to filter IOCs (string). This is a recommended option for the IOC Stream data ingestion type to filter relevant IOCs and reduce noise.

- **Container Creation:**  
  All IOC Stream data for a given UTC day will be ingested into a single container. A new container is created each day (UTC-based).

## DTM Alerts

- **Parameters:**
  - **Monitor ID:** Filter alerts by the specified monitor ID(s). Supports multiple comma-separated values (string).
  - **Status:** Filter alerts by status. Possible values: `new`, `read`, `escalated`, `in_progress`, `closed`, `no_action_required`, `duplicate`, `not_relevant`, `tracked_external`. Supports multiple comma-separated values (string).
  - **Alert Type:** Filter alerts by alert type. Possible values: `Compromised Credentials`, `Domain Discovery`, `Forum Post`, `Message`, `Paste`, `Shop Listing`, `Tweet`, `Web Content`. Supports multiple comma-separated values (string).
  - **Search:** Search alerts and triggering documents using a Lucene query with text values joined by AND/OR (string).
  - **Match Value:** Filter alerts by specified match value. Supports multiple comma-separated values (string).
  - **Tags:** Filter alerts by tags. Supports multiple comma-separated values (string).
  - **Severity:** Filter alerts by specified severity. Possible values: `high`, `medium`, `low`. Supports multiple comma-separated values (string).
  - **MScore GTE:** Filter alerts with mscores greater than or equal to the given value (numeric, 0 to 100).

- **Status Mapping of DTM Alerts:**

  | DTM Alert Status      | SOAR Container Status |
  |----------------------|----------------------|
  | New                  | New                  |
  | Read                 | Open                 |
  | Escalated            | Open                 |
  | In Progress          | Open                 |
  | Closed               | Closed               |
  | No Action Required   | Closed               |
  | Duplicate            | Closed               |
  | Not Relevant         | Closed               |
  | Tracked External     | Closed               |

- **Severity Mapping of DTM Alerts:**

  | DTM Alert Severity | SOAR Container Severity |
  |--------------------|------------------------|
  | High               | High                   |
  | Medium             | Medium                 |
  | Low                | Low                    |

- **Container Creation:**  
  Each DTM alert will result in the creation of a separate container. One artifact will be created inside the container and will have certain important fields from alert visible inside the artifact. To get complete details about the alert, download the artifact JSON.

- **Container Updates:**  
  Containers or artifacts will **not** be updated if the alert is updated in GTI after ingestion.

- **Closing DTM Alerts in GTI:**  
  When a DTM alert container is closed in Splunk SOAR, the playbook provided in this [repository](https://github.com/virusTotal/gti-soar-playbooks/tree/main/Splunk%20SOAR) automatically closes the corresponding alert in GTI.

## ASM Issues

- **Parameters:**
  - **Search String:** Search string (fields `last_seen_after`, `last_seen_before`, and `first_seen_after` will be ignored). This is a recommended option for the ASM Issues data ingestion type to filter relevant issues and reduce noise (string).
  - **Project ID:** Project ID (string).

- **Status Mapping of ASM Issues:**

  | ASM Issue Status     | SOAR Container Status |
  |---------------------|----------------------|
  | Open                | Open                 |
  | Triaged             | Open                 |
  | In Progress         | Open                 |
  | Closed              | Closed               |
  | Mitigated           | Closed               |
  | Resolved            | Closed               |
  | Duplicate           | Closed               |
  | Out of Scope        | Closed               |
  | Benign              | Closed               |
  | Risk Accepted       | Closed               |
  | False Positive      | Closed               |
  | Unable to Reproduce | Closed               |
  | Tracked Externally  | Closed               |

- **Severity Mapping of ASM Issues:**

  | ASM Issue Severity | SOAR Container Severity |
  |--------------------|------------------------|
  | 1                  | High                   |
  | 2                  | High                   |
  | 3                  | Medium                 |
  | 4                  | Low                    |
  | 5                  | Low                    |

- **Container Creation:**  
  Each ASM issue will result in the creation of a separate container. One artifact will be created inside the container and will have certain important fields from issue visible inside the artifact. To get complete details about the issue, download the artifact JSON.

- **Container Updates:**  
  Fields of artifacts inside the container will be updated **only if** the `last_seen` value of the issue changes in GTI. If there are any other updates but the `last_seen` field hasn't changed, the artifact will not be updated.

- **Closing ASM Issues in GTI:**  
  When an ASM issue container is closed in Splunk SOAR, the playbook provided in this [repository](https://github.com/virusTotal/gti-soar-playbooks/tree/main/Splunk%20SOAR) automatically closes the corresponding issue in GTI.
